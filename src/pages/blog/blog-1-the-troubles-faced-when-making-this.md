OH MY GOODNESS. The entire horrors faced here were absolutely BONKERS!

Let me walk you through this.

This theme, Astro Ink uses Astro Beta, when Astro 1.0 is out. So, after generating my own Astrosite(hence the repo name), the first thing I needed to do was a test, where I realized this uses `astro@beta`.

Bummer.

I immediately switched the package to Astro 1, then faced a set of horrors of replacing multiple packages to their new package home. Then, today, I changed the path(`$/`) to `../`, which redirects to the actual files. That came with torture since it went to all files. So, after a few agonizing(except from 6 pm to 8 pm) hours(long time and customization later, here we are.

See you later, and sorry for this stupidly short blog!

PS: to know more about the agony, go to the repo and check GitHub Actions.
