It's been a long, long time since I've posted here, right? Some things may be in the backlog(blogs, that is), to be honest.
So, where the hell have I been?

School.

Yeah. School. I finished my Grade 10, with good marks, and am doing my 11th. Being an Indian, the next thing to focus on here for me is the 12th Boards, and the JEE Olympiad, one of the most daunting things ever. Luckily, I'm preparing for that.

Meanwhile, here, everything has changed. People have... disappeared, or just moved on. The very thing I considered my greatest achievement, helping those in need in code-server, is now a relic of the past. The problems are far more technical, and mind you, I just know Python and HTML.

So, I just vanished. I rarely opened the GitHub client on my phone. I doted Type-on-Strap a long time ago, and now, the creator is adding new changes. There were so many changes to keep track of, and I never got the time to do so.

There are only a few people who might see this blog. It has honestly been months since I made a commit on GitHub. I started a project, [Weather](https://github.com/Futura-Py/weather), but all of us people on the team have just moved on, or are too busy with everything we are facing.

I finished a course on Python, which my dumb self must have done years ago, but now, I get the OOP, and I just love it. Though, I haven't been practicing, coding enough. The skills that I once prided myself upon, they are waning. It is all muscle memory now, all quick flashes of ideas.

And now, when I am doing nothing on GitHub, people start following me, and I don't know why. Maybe it was my work, the help I once gave to the ones in need, or something else.

And now, I am writing this. It's been so damn long, I must have done this a long time ago.

I think it is time to change things up. Since I have chosen computer science as my optional subject(not a surprise.), I've been coding Python and SQL. Maybe, I'll commit them here. I think that's what I'm going to do.

To all of you who read this, I am returning. Better than ever.

It is time.
